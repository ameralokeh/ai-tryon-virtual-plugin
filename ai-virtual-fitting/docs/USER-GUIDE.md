## Introduction

### What is AI Virtual Fitting?

AI Virtual Fitting is an innovative technology that allows you to try on wedding dresses virtually using artificial intelligence. Instead of physically trying on multiple dresses, you can upload your photo and see how different wedding dress styles look on you—all from the comfort of your home.

The technology uses Google AI Studio's advanced Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model to create realistic virtual try-on experiences. The AI analyzes your photo and seamlessly blends the selected wedding dress onto your image, giving you a realistic preview of how the dress would look on you.

### How It Works

The virtual fitting process is powered by sophisticated AI technology that:

1. **Analyzes Your Photo**: The AI examines your uploaded photo to understand your body shape, pose, and positioning
2. **Processes the Dress**: The system retrieves high-quality images of the selected wedding dress from multiple angles
3. **Creates the Fitting**: Advanced AI algorithms blend the dress onto your photo, adjusting for lighting, shadows, and perspective
4. **Generates the Result**: Within 30-60 seconds, you receive a realistic image showing how the dress looks on you

The entire process is automated and requires no technical knowledge—simply upload your photo, select a dress, and let the AI do the work!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is virtual fitting?**

A: Virtual fitting is an AI-powered technology that allows you to see how wedding dresses look on you without physically trying them on. You upload your photo, select a dress, and the AI creates a realistic image of you wearing that dress.

**Q: How accurate is the virtual fitting?**

A: The virtual fitting provides a good representation of how a dress style will look on you, including the silhouette, neckline, and overall appearance. However, it's a guide, not a perfect replica. We recommend using it to narrow down your choices before in-person fittings.

**Q: Do I need special equipment?**

A: No special equipment is needed. You just need:
- A smartphone or camera to take your photo
- A computer or mobile device with internet access
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

**Q: Is my photo stored or shared?**

A: Your photos are processed securely and used only for creating your virtual fitting results. Photos are not shared with third parties. Temporary files are automatically deleted after processing. Check the website's privacy policy for complete details.

**Q: Can I use the same photo for multiple dresses?**

A: Yes! Once you upload a photo, you can use it to try on multiple dresses. You don't need to upload it again unless you want to use a different photo.

### Credit Questions

**Q: How many free credits do I get?**

A: New users receive 2 free credits automatically when creating an account. This allows you to try the virtual fitting feature twice before purchasing more credits.

**Q: How much do additional credits cost?**

A: The standard package is 20 credits for $10.00 USD, which works out to $0.50 per virtual fitting. Check the website for current pricing and any special offers.

**Q: Do credits expire?**

A: By default, credits do not expire. However, the store may configure an expiration policy. Check your account or contact support for specific details about credit expiration.

**Q: What happens if processing fails?**

A: If processing fails due to a system error before the AI starts working, your credit typically won't be deducted. If you believe a credit was deducted incorrectly, contact support with the transaction details.

**Q: Can I get a refund on credits?**

A: Credit refunds are subject to the store's refund policy. Contact customer support with your order number and reason for the refund request.


### Photo Questions

**Q: What kind of photo should I use?**

A: Use a clear, recent photo of yourself with:
- Good, even lighting
- Plain, solid-colored background
- Standing straight, facing the camera
- Full body or upper body visible
- High resolution (800x600 minimum)
- Form-fitting clothing

**Q: Can I use a professional photo?**

A: Yes! Professional photos often work very well because they typically have good lighting and composition. Just ensure the photo meets all the guidelines (plain background, standing pose, etc.).

**Q: Can I use a selfie?**

A: Selfies can work, but they're not ideal because:
- Usually taken from an angle
- Often don't show enough of the body
- May have inconsistent lighting
- Typically lower quality

For best results, have someone else take your photo or use a tripod with a timer.

**Q: What if I don't have a full-body photo?**

A: A photo showing at least from your head to below your waist can work. However, full-body photos provide better results because the AI can see your complete proportions and create a more accurate virtual fitting.

**Q: Can I edit my photo before uploading?**

A: Light editing is okay (adjusting brightness, cropping), but avoid:
- Heavy filters or effects
- Significant color changes
- Body modifications
- Adding or removing elements

The more natural your photo, the better the results.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How long does processing take?**

A: Typical processing time is 30-60 seconds. Factors that can affect processing time include:
- Server load
- Image complexity
- Internet connection speed
- AI processing queue

**Q: What file formats are supported?**

A: Supported formats are:
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- WebP (.webp)

Maximum file size is 10MB.

**Q: What browsers are supported?**

A: The virtual fitting works on modern browsers including:
- Google Chrome 90+
- Mozilla Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Microsoft Edge 90+

Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.

**Q: Can I use it on my phone?**

A: Yes! The virtual fitting page is mobile-friendly and works on smartphones and tablets. However, for the best experience, we recommend using a desktop or laptop computer with a larger screen.


### Usage Questions

**Q: Can I try on the same dress multiple times?**

A: Yes, but each virtual fitting uses one credit, even if you're trying the same dress again. If you want to see the same dress with a different photo, that would use another credit.

**Q: Can I share my results?**

A: Yes! Once you download your virtual fitting result, you can share it however you like—via email, social media, messaging apps, or print it out. The image is yours to use.

**Q: How do I compare different dresses?**

A: Download the result from each virtual fitting and view them side-by-side on your device. You can also print them out or share them with friends and family for feedback.

**Q: What if I don't like the result?**

A: The virtual fitting is a guide to help you visualize different dress styles. If you don't like how a dress looks, that's valuable information! It helps you narrow down your choices. Remember, the credit is used for the AI processing, regardless of whether you like the result.

**Q: Can I try on dresses not shown in the slider?**

A: You can only try on dresses that are available in the product slider on the virtual fitting page. If you'd like to see a specific dress added, contact the store administrator.

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**

A: Yes, an account is required to use the virtual fitting feature. This allows the system to:
- Track your credit balance
- Save your virtual fitting history
- Process payments for credit purchases
- Provide personalized service

### Results Questions

**Q: What resolution are the result images?**

A: Result images are high-quality and typically match or exceed the resolution of your uploaded photo. They're suitable for viewing on screen, sharing, and printing.

**Q: How long can I access my results?**

A: Download your results immediately after processing. While the system may store results temporarily, it's best to download and save them to your own device for permanent access.

**Q: Can I get a printed version?**

A: You can print the downloaded result image yourself using any photo printer or printing service. The high-quality JPEG format is suitable for printing.

**Q: Why doesn't the dress look exactly like it would in person?**

A: Virtual fitting uses AI to create a representation based on your photo and the dress images. Factors like lighting, fabric drape, and exact fit can vary from the virtual result. Use it as a helpful guide, then try on your favorite dresses in person for the final decision.


### Purchase and Payment Questions

**Q: What payment methods are accepted?**

A: Payment methods depend on the store's configuration but typically include:
- Credit/Debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express)
- PayPal
- Other payment gateways configured by the store

Check the checkout page for available options.

**Q: Is my payment information secure?**

A: Yes. Payments are processed through WooCommerce's secure payment system. The virtual fitting plugin doesn't store your payment information. All transactions are encrypted and secure.

**Q: Will I receive a receipt?**

A: Yes, you'll receive an email confirmation with your order details and receipt after purchasing credits. You can also access receipts in your account order history.

**Q: Can I purchase credits as a gift?**

A: This depends on the store's configuration. Contact the store administrator to inquire about gift purchases or gift certificates.
